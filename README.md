# face-recognition-attendence-system

In the modern world, education system is advancing day-by-day due to
the introduction of concept of smart classroom. However, the
attendance system still remains primitive, where the teacher/lecturer
calls the name of students to mark their attendance. The automatic
attendance management will replace the manual method, which takes
a lot of time, that is, it is very time consuming and is difficult to
maintain. There are many biometric processes, among which face
recognition is the best method. In this project, we are going to
describe the attendance without human interference. In this method
the camera is fixed within the classroom and it'll capture the image,
the faces are detected and then it's recognized with the database and
finally the attendance is marked. In order to effectively employ such
differences, we exploit frequency and texture information using
various algorithms. We will be trying to improve the accuracy to a
great extent and thus generate the final attendance report after
updation in the database.
